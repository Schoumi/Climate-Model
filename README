Simclimat 1.0d
--------------

To compile (for example on Ubuntu karmik or Debian), you will need to install the following packages:

libgtkglextmm-x11-1.2-dev libgtkmm-2.4-dev libglibmm-2.4-dev libcairomm-1.0-dev build-essential g++

The makefile should  do everything: the main exe is ./gui/climat (to be launched from the folder which contains gui, not gui itself) 
make
(make install)
